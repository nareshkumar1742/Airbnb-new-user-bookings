Predicting destination preference of the new user
**Business Problem**
                    Airbnb has consistently been one of the best site for travellers which helps them to find hotels, room stays and tourism activities that suits the travellers wish. Airbnb has lot of improvised features that help travellers filter, sort and choose the best that fits their interest. It is working on enhancing the user interface in a way that could reduce the searching time of the users by providing them with the services that they expect. Thereby they increase their quality of service.
**Problem Statement**
                    Here we have to predict the desired destination of the first time users, thereby we can have the knowledge of the what the user expects and can show them with the more personalised content, thus decreasing the average time of the first booking. We are provided with user's basic details (like browser, devcie type, etc) and also browser sessions data.
